### Game Rules

The Memory Game is a classic card-matching game with a twist. You'll be presented with cards that contain words in either German or English, depending on your selected category. Your goal is to match each word with its corresponding translation by flipping the cards and using your memory.

- Click on a card to reveal its word.
- Click on a second card to reveal its word.
- If the two cards match, they'll remain face-up.
- If they don't match, they'll flip back over, and you can try again.
- Keep flipping and matching until you've matched all the pairs! The game is a fun and engaging way to expand your vocabulary and test your memory skills.
